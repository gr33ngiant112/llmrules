# Self-Improvement & Continuous Learning

## 1. Lessons Learned Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern.
- Identify the mistake, the root cause, and the rule to prevent it in the future.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at the start of every session.

## 2. Iterative Rule Improvement
- Ruthlessly iterate on project rules (`CLAUDE.md`, `.clauderules`) until the mistake rate drops.
- Update global rules if a pattern is observed across multiple projects.

## 3. Knowledge Sharing
- Document architectural decisions and complex flows to help future agent sessions.
- Use the `save_memory` tool for global user preferences and high-level context only.
