# Documentation Standards

## 1. Project README
- Follow standard guidelines for the main project `README.md`.
- Include: Overview, Tech Stack, Tech/Domain Architecture, Installation, Usage, Commands.
- Keep it concise and high-signal.

## 2. Task Tracking
- Use `tasks/todo.md` for active work tracking.
- Use `tasks/lessons.md` for capturing learning.
- Use `BLOCKED_FEATURES.md` for external dependencies or manual intervention requirements.

## 3. Minimalist Documentation
- Prioritize code clarity and comments over external docs.
- Only create additional markdown files if strictly necessary for architectural clarity.
- Ask before creating large-scale documentation repositories.
